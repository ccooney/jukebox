# building

```sh
run mvn package. this will build the entire project
```

# running

in order to run this project, run the following after building:

```sh
java -jar target/mixtape-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar <in> <change> <out>
```

## changes file

changes is a json file matching the following structure
```json
{
  "addSongToPlaylist": [
    {
    	"songId": 1,
    	"playlistId": 1
    }
  ],
  "addUserPlaylist": [
    {
    	"userId": 1,
    	"playlist": [
    		{
    			"playlist_id": 1,
    			"songs": [1,2,3]
    		}
    	]
    }
  ],
  "removePlaylist": [
    {
    	"playlistId": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

## validation

the unit tests cover several common positive and negative scenarios and
manipulate the data structures generated by json parsing

more holistically, crafting changes files on the form provided above and
diffing the results will demonstrate that the app is making expected
changes and that it catches errors in change files without producing output

for best results, run once with an empty changes file to eliminate lexical c
hanges from the encoding steps

## changes for large file sizes

in order to scale to large datasets and change orders, we xan implement
the following changes:


* import jukebox using SAX style parsing and store in a tuple store
* import changes (also sax style)
* apply the changes in sequence. track errors as they occur
* at the end, if no errors have occured, dump tuple store to outFile
* delete the tuple store
